# project1_team7
We chose to analyze a dataset of Natural Disasters around the world between the years 1900 and 2021.

We have uploaded our code as 4 separate .py files divided in 4 branches. Each file corresponds to the code that was used to analyze data and generate charts to be able to answer each question. On each branch we can find the png files for each chart as well as the .py file with the code.

Question 1: Are Natural Disasters increasing or  decreasing over time? And, which ones are the most common? Git branch: erik_script.py, file name: Question #1.ipynb

Question 2: How do different disasters occur in different world regions recently? Git branch: karen_script.py, file name: Question #2.ipynb

Question 3: Is there a correlation between all the data? Git branch: oliva_script.py, file name: Question #3.ipynb

Question 4: What happened to the number of deaths and number of disasters over the years? How can we explain it? Git branch: pedro_script, file name: Question #4.ipynb

We uploaded the major findings word document on the MAIN branch, the file name is: P1_T7_WrittenAnalysis.docx.pdf

We uploaded the presentation used in class on the MAIN branch, the file name is: P1_T7_Presentation.pptx
