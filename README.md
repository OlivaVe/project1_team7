We have uploaded our code as 4 separate .py files. Each file corresponds to the code that was used to analyze data and generate charts to be able to answer each question.

Question 1: Are Natural Disasters increasing or  decreasing over time? And, which ones are the most common?

Question 2: How do different disasters occur in different world regions recently?

Question 3: Is there a correlation between all the data?

Question 4: What happened to the number of deaths and number of disasters over the years? How can we explain it?
