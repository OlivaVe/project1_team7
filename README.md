We have uploaded our code as 4 separate .py files divided in 4 branches. Each file corresponds to the code that was used to analyze data and generate charts to be able to answer each question. On each branch we can find the png files for each chart as well as the .py file with the code.

Question 1: Are Natural Disasters increasing or  decreasing over time? And, which ones are the most common? Git branch: erik_scrip.py

Question 2: How do different disasters occur in different world regions recently? Git branch: karen_scrip.py
